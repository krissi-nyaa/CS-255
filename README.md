# CS-255 - Portfolio

## Description
For CS-255, I created two major milestones for a project:
- The DriverPass business requirements document showcasing requirements gathering and product specs.
- The DriverPass mock system-design for a web-app targeting helping students pass their driving test by scheduling time with an instructor


## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?What did you do particularly well?
In the DriverPass project, I believe I used my experience as a Systems Architect to properly recommend the correct method of implementation for creating the desired system. The client was a group with loose ideas that wanted to make their application into a reality, but needed some light guidance. Initially, they wanted something that could do things that are not typical in design patterns and would have created a lot of problems downstream. I believe I did a good job guiding them to a more managable and successful solution :)

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to create more in-depth design documents. Although a lot of what I did describes pieces of the system, it lacks a full architectual diagram that showcases how everything ties together.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took each of the user's requirements into consideration and created recommendations based on their inferred priorities and best practices. It's important to keep their needs in mind because they are the ones who should be directing how things work. As a design consultant, we simply help push them in the right direction technology-wise.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Software design is best approached in phases and zoomed far, far out. I personally like to summarize all the requirements into a few general problem statements before figuring out how to solve the requirements. By doing things this way, I am able to guide my design more personably to the client's needs. I typically never accept requirements such as "the program needs to do X," instead, I work with them until we can rephrase it to something like "because the users need Y, the program needs to do X." Doing this helps me justify /why/ I'm doing things in a particular way.
